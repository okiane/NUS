Make it harmonious with the Golden Angle\n<p>Plants arrange their leaves in spirals. A spiral is a curve which starts from the origin and <em>moves away</em> from the origin as it revolves around it. In the plot above all our points are the same distance from the origin. A simple way to arrange them in a spiral is to multiply <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> by a factor which increases for each point. We <em>could</em> use <code>t</code> as that factor, as it meets these conditions, but we will do something more <em>harmonious</em>. We will use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_angle\">Golden Angle</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Golden Angle = π(3 − √5)</p>\n<p>This number is inspired by the Golden Ratio, one of the most famous numbers in the history of mathematics. Imagine that you have a circumference and you break up it into two arcs with lengths <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, with <code>a&gt;b</code> (an arc is a portion of the circumference). The angle that <em>breaks</em> the circle so that <code>a/b=(a+b)/a</code> is called the Golden Angle. In other words: the Golden Angle <em>breaks up</em> a circle so that the ratio of the big arc to the little arc is the Golden Ratio. This image (from Wikipedia) illustrates the previous definition:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_62/img/Golden_Angle.png\" height=\"300\" width=\"300\"></p>\n<p>The Golden Angle is the angle subtended by the smaller (red) arc.
